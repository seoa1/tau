# Phase 17.5: TUI Transcript Wrapping

Phase 17.5 hardens the Textual transcript surface so it behaves more like a
minimal chat stack.

The implementation lives in:

```text
src/tau_coding/tui/app.py
src/tau_coding/tui/widgets.py
```

## What was added

Transcript items now render as standalone colored blocks instead of prefixed
lines such as `you:` or `assistant:`.

The display state remains simple:

```python
ChatItem(role="user", text="...")
```

Only the Textual renderer decides how to display that item. This preserves the
core boundary:

```text
CodingSession emits events
TuiEventAdapter builds display state
TranscriptView renders blocks
```

## Wrapping behavior

`TranscriptView` still uses Textual's `RichLog`, but it is created with:

```python
min_width=1
wrap=True
```

This removes RichLog's default wide minimum width and lets normal user and
assistant messages reflow to the available terminal width. Chat block bodies use
Rich `Text` with folded overflow so long unbroken strings are wrapped inside the
block instead of forcing horizontal scrolling.

Tool output and code-like text preserve line breaks. Very long unbroken chunks
are folded intentionally rather than clipped.

## Visual model

Each role gets a distinct dark block style:

- user
- assistant
- tool
- status
- error

The role is expressed by color, not by an inline label. This keeps the TUI
minimal while still making transcript structure scannable.

## Tests

The phase is covered by:

```text
tests/test_tui_app.py
```

The tests verify:

- chat items render without `you:`, `assistant:`, or `tool:` prefixes
- long unbroken message text folds within a narrow console width
- the mounted transcript uses a narrow `min_width`
